An open microphone can be dangerous
Let's tune in on two of the greatest MC's out there

Passion, the will to win, the spark within
Passion, the strength within the hearts of men
Passion, the drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through

Passion, to play through pain and love the game
Passion, to break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion, the fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through passion

Propaganda, positive propositions
Politician, musician and a triple optician
Still part of my missions to slaughter the opposition
Critics that don't get it, I tell 'em to stop bitchin'

I do without blacks, I've done it without cash
Strictly for the love of the art, that's passion
Flashin', rappin' or jammin' or sound blastin'
When Quannum meets Expansion, this is what happens

Runnin' through the jungle with a flare gun
Arrow-arms, zonin' out my mind
Like I was hooked on heroine
Take the fire, turn it up and blaze whole forest down
Pullin from within' the inner insane warrior

California to the District of Columbia
Hella high octane, lookin' through a lazy eye
All ablaze, fire, flames, lightin' up the sky
Runnin' through the burnin' sun, yellin'
Ride nigga, ride nigga, ride

Passion, the will to win, the spark within
Passion, the strength within the hearts of men
Passion, the drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived, the quest is driven through

Passion, to play through pain and love the game
Passion, to break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion, the fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived, the quest is driven through passion

Desire, the fire that inspires
I don't state facts, I state buildings, like empires
Passion, the journey, the learnin', the time-turnin'
The searchin', the mind yearnin' to wake and find mornin'

Passion, the ladies, they love the long-lastin'
Askin' for action, braced for satisfaction
Passion, the black-skinned African
Jazz-men of the half in Aspen
Relaxed, gettin' my back rubbed

I'm still here, I've seen cats get killed here
I've seen cats make a mil but millionaires still fear
You can buy airplanes but you can't buy cheers
Blackalicious, dilated, vibratin' your ears

Sent vibrations for years, I've been waitin' for years
I've been patient for years, we ain't playin' this year
We hold stake in this here, it ain't safe for this year
We in the zone watch next level, takin' it there, this is

Passion, the will to win, the spark within
Passion, the strength within the hearts of men
Passion, the drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived, the quest is driven through

Passion, to play through pain and love the game
Passion, to break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion, the fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived, the quest is driven through passion

Let's listen to this recipe for Chief Xcel
The most astonishing Soul
New seeds of wisdom, craft, and skill
Check it out, y'all
Listen now, to this classic moment from
DJ's, around the world, DJ's around the world

Had a rough week, it got beat by passion
Saddled up, tweaked off a beat, started mashin'
Matador Rica, the heat from the heater
In her world, dwellin', hear the world, yellin' for a leader

I don't bother with the dealers, I take it to the lab
It's Rakaa chillin' with Babs, Xcel, gift of gab
I grab mics and fans gravitate, I can't waste it
My whole life, I wanted it so bad, I could taste it

Passion, the will to win, the spark within
Passion, the strength within the hearts of men
Passion, the drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through

Passion, to play through pain and love the game
Passion, to break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion, the fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived, the quest is driven through passion
