When lips touch mine
When we're together

Our souls entwine
Lasting forever

Close the door
Lay here beside me

There's so much more
I knew there would be

There's a real,
Real,
Real,
Power of passion

A real,
Real,
Real,
Power of passion

There is no other way
For you and I to be here

What more can I say
I want you to be near, baby

Don't ask why
Question that could be

It's a natural high
Higher than we would be

It's a real,
Real,
Real,
Power of passion

A real,
Real,
Real,
Power of passion

A real,
Real,
Real,
Power of passion

A real,
Real,
Real,
Love satisfaction

Lost in my eyes
Of knowing

Big blue skies
Love fire's burning

Just tell me once (I love you)
That you love me

There's a love beacon
I knew it would be, baby (Need to do it)

It's a real,
Real,
Real,
Power of passion

A real,
Real,
Real,
Power of passion

A real,
Real,
Real,
Power of passion

A real,
Real,
Real,
Love satisfaction
