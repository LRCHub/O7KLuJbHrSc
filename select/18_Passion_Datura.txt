You are the passion
Dream on
You, you are the passion
Dream on

I get a feeling I'm needing it now
I have a feeling the rhythm's gonna take control
I know the music will open my mind
And when I'm dancing I'm wanting it more and more
And more and more

You are the power for everyone to see
You are the freedom 'cause every life is free
You are the passion turn on and visualise
You are the rhythm, dream on, open your eyes

I get a feeling I'm doing it now, yeah
I feel I'm melting the walls of reality
I know the music will open the door
(The door, the door)
Until my body is whole and my mind is free
So free so free

You are the power for everyone to see
You are the freedom 'cause every life is free
You are the passion turn on and visualise
You are the rhythm, dream on, open your eyes

You are the power for everyone to see
You are the freedom 'cause every life is free
You are the passion turn on and visualise
You are the rhythm, dream on and close your eyes

Dream on
(Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes...)
(Dream on, dream on, dream on...)

You are the power for everyone to see
You are the freedom 'cause every life is free
You are the passion turn on and visualise
You are the rhythm, dream on, open your eyes

You are the power for everyone to see
You are the freedom 'cause every life is free
You are the passion turn on and visualise
You are the rhythm, dream on and close your eyes

You are the power for everyone to see
You are the freedom 'cause every life is free
You are the passion turn on and visualise
You are the rhythm, dream on, open your eyes
