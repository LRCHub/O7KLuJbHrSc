Confined and concealed
Where nothing is real
Smokes far away
Blows down course
Whole body absorbed
Opinion exposed
Sift powder and load
You send me

Your passion flower
You scream and get loud
Release yourself

They're choking your air
Senses beware
A hazened rich sky
Your loud cry
Fast pace, slow
Infecting your own
To sink is to soar
You send me

Your passion flower
You scream and get loud
Release yourself,
Your passion flower
You scream and get loud
Release yourself

It sometimes seems like the only way I'll get by
When my head's stretched and my mouth is dry
And I feel undressed to the naked eye
Pacing back and fourth side to side
When your head stays in the pillow, boy
Hey man it's good to get loud alone
Don't bother getting all depressed
You're out in four

Your passion flower
You scream and get loud
Release yourself
Your passion flower
You scream and get loud
Release yourself

Your passion flower
Your passion flower
Your passion flower
Your passion
Your passion
Your passion

He thinks about going somewhere
His whole life
